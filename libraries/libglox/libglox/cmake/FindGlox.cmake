FindGlox
-------

Finds the Glox library.

-----------------------
This module provides the following imported targets, if found:

Glox::Glox
	The Glox library

-----------------------
This will define the following variables:

GLOX_FOUND
	True if the system has the Glox library.
GLOX_INCLUDE_DIRS
	Include directories needed to use Glox.
GLOX_LIBRARIES
	Libraries needed to link to Glox.

-----------------------
Following Flags control behavior

GlOX_ROOT
	Glox root directory
GLOX_LIBRARY
	Hint for finding library location
GLOX_FIND_SHARED
	Set if shared library needs to be found
